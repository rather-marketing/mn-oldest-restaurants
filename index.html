            <h3>Throughout time, many restaurants in Minnesota have faced periods of turmoil that they couldn't withstand - fires, the Great Depression, Prohibition, and Covid. 
                Read on for a list of Minnesota's oldest restaurants that have stood the test of time and are still operating today.</h3>

            <img src="/images/img-hubbell-outside.jpg" />
            <h4>Hubbell House in Mantorville - Est. 1854</h4>
            <p>Back in 1854 when the Hubbell Hotel was built, there was a single dining room. The restaurant was expanded when the Pappas family assumed control of the restaurant in 1946 and to this day, continue to follow the family motto:</p>
            <blockquote cite=“https://www.hubbellhouserestaurant.com>
            "Put a good meal on the plate, charge a fair price, offer a pleasant atmosphere and treat your customers and employees right. If you do, people will come back.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="list-container">
            <img src="/images/img-neumann-outside.jpg" />
            <h4>Neumann’s Bar & Grill in North St. Paul - Est. 1887</h4>
            <p>This establishment makes the list with one caveat - it opened in 1887 as a saloon with no mention of serving food. Fortunately, the building and character have remained mostly unchanged. You can still see the keyhole window to the upstairs prohibition-era speakeasy that ensured only "welcomed" guests could enter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-container">
            <img src="/images/img-montecarlo.jpg" />
            <h4>Monte Carlo in Minneapolis - Est. 1906</h4>
            <p>That it is so old seems a secret. This establishment features a copper-topped bar, intimate booths in the main dining room, an expansive patio and private dining rooms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-container">
            <img src="/images/img-pickwick-outside.jpg" />
            <h4>Pickwick Restaurant & Pub in Duluth - Est. 1914</h4>
            <p>The Pickwick opened in 1888 as the Old Saloon within Fitger's, but it has operated at its current location since 1914, surviving the Great Depression and changing ownership only a few times. The Pickwick offers award-worthy meals with an Old World atmosphere.

        <div class="list-container">
            <img src="/images/img-coney-outside.jpg" />
            <h4>Deluxe Coney Island in Duluth - Est. 1928</h4>
            <p>With no alcohol on the menu, this establishment is a true contender that dates back to pre-prohibition times and is still family owned. They offer coneys & gyros served with their signature Coney Sauce crafted from the same old-world family recipe.</p>
